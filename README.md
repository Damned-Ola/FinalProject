In our Final Project we made a cybershop web site where you can buy some headphones and keyboards. Web site is responsible and you can registrate yourself adn the log in. 
In your own account you can search and then add particular items in your profile. We created an API with node and connected out server through terminal. When you registrate yourself the data saves in our json database 
then log in with the same data from database. We used promises and have 3 resources in our db.json.
